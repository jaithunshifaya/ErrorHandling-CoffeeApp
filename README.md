# ☕ ErrorHandling-CoffeeApp

This repository contains a simple **Java-based Coffee App** project with a focus on practicing **error handling** in Java. The project simulates a basic coffee machine with different coffee types.

## 📚 Overview
The project is structured to:
- Demonstrate the use of **Java classes and objects**.
- Practice **exception handling** techniques for real-world scenarios like coffee machine errors.
- Simulate a coffee ordering system.

## 🏗️ Project Structure

home/coder/coursera/Solution/src/
│

├── Coffee.java # Base class for Coffee

├── CoffeeMachine.java # Main class for simulating the coffee machine

├── Espresso.java # Subclass representing Espresso

└── Latte.java # Subclass representing Latte

## 🚀 How to Run
1️⃣ Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/jaithunshifaya/ErrorHandling-CoffeeApp.git

## 2️⃣ Navigate to the source folder:

cd ErrorHandling-CoffeeApp/home/coder/coursera/Solution/src

## 3️⃣ Compile the Java files:

javac *.java

## 4️⃣ Run the main class (CoffeeMachine):

java CoffeeMachine

## 🌟 Features
Object-oriented design with base and subclass hierarchy.

Error handling for typical coffee machine issues (e.g., out of ingredients, machine malfunction).

Demonstrates inheritance and polymorphism concepts.

## 📝 Future Enhancements
Expand to support additional coffee types (e.g., Cappuccino, Mocha).

Add a user interface (console-based or GUI).

Include unit tests for each class.
